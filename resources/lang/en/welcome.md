Hello!

Hopefully installation went fast and painless. Good news - it's done!
You are in the main view of Codice displaying all your notes (or tasks, if only you specify deadline). 
This particular note is marked as done - this can be recognized thanks to green bar on its left. If you want, hover a
note and click <span class="note-btn"><i class="fa fa-times"></i> Undone</span> on the right side of its footer.
Status indicator should change to orange, reminding you that deadline is close.

You can find labels assigned to this task on top right. You can add new using a link in the menu above
or right from the note <span class="note-btn"><i class="fa fa-pencil"></i> Edit</span> screen!

That should be enough for now - you can finally click on that <span class="note-btn"><i class="fa fa-trash-o"></i>
Remove</span> button ;)

Read [The Basics](http://docs.codice.eu/basics) chapter in the documentation - it is short introduction to Codice,
containing informations written here and even more.
